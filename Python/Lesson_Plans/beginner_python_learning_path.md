# Beginner Python Learning Path
- Hello World!
- Take the year of my birth, and calculate my age (just (now - then) no month corrections). (simple math, input, output)
- Ask for a direction(Up, down, left, right), then tell the user their fate (fall in a hole, find a cake, ect). (Boolean logic)
- FizzBuzz, but count once every second. (Loops, timers, and more logic)
- Depending on their age some really like an app which calls the users a random insult at some interval. (Loops, arrays, timers, and random if you make the interval random)
